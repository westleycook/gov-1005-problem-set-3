```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Loading libraries that I assume will come in handy: tidyverse for its dplyr
# and ggplot2 packages, reprex in case I need to use it to ask for help online,
# janitor to clean my data, and gt because I'll have to produce a table.

library(tidyverse)
library(reprex)

```

```{r read_in_data, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk reads in the xian data and cleans it.

xian <- read_csv("./raw-data/xian_data.csv",
                 
# Skipping three rows to get the column names to the top of the data frame

```

## Madlibs

```{r mad-lib-1, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 1.

# Filtering xian data for only those rows where treatment is 1 (meaning those
# respondents who received treatment), then counting the number of rows and
# pulling the value of n and assigning it to the object treatment_respondents

treatment_respondents <- xian %>% 
  filter(treatment == 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

```

1. **`r treatment_respondents`** respondents are in the treatment group.

```{r mad-lib-2, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 2.

# As above, filtering xian for those rows where treatment is 1;, then creating a
# column (gov_avg_in_treatment_group) to house the average of overall ratings
# for members of the treatment group, removing all the NA values because they're
# incompatible with the mean() operation. Pulling the result and assigning it to
# the object gov_avg_rating_in_treatment_group (which is probably too long a
# name, but it's descriptive).

gov_avg_rating_in_treatment_group <- xian %>% 
  filter(treatment == 1) %>% 
  summarize(gov_avg_in_treatment_group = mean(eval_gov_overall, 
                                              na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  pull(gov_avg_in_treatment_group)

```

2. Among respondents from the treatment group, the government has an average
**`r gov_avg_rating_in_treatment_group`** rating.

```{r mad-lib-3, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 3.

# To find the most common rating for traffic, I count() the eval_gov_traffic
# column (which gives me two columns as a result, one for the values that make
# an appearance in the eval_gov_traffic column and one called n which shows how
# many times they appear). I then arrange the dataframe in descending order (so
# the most commonly-given rating is in the first row) and slice() that row. I
# pull() the value in the eval_gov_traffic column and assign it to
# most_common_traffic.

most_common_traffic <- xian %>% 
  count(eval_gov_traffic) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  pull(eval_gov_traffic)

```

3. The most common rating for the government’s handling of traffic is 
**`r most_common_traffic`**.

```{r mad-lib-4, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 4.

# I use filter() to leave only the rows in the dataframe where either overall,
# demolitions, or traffic rating is 10. I then count() those rows and pull() the
# n column to assign the total count (number of times a row in the dataframe
# contains 10 in any of the three rating categories) to any_ten_count.

any_ten_count <- xian %>% 
  filter(eval_gov_overall == 10 |
         eval_gov_demo == 10 |
         eval_gov_traffic == 10) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

```

4. **`r any_ten_count`** respondents have given the government a 10 rating
overall or on demolitions or on traffic.

```{r mad-lib-5, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 5.

# I modify the code from mad lib 4 just slightly, replacing "or" bars (|) with
# commas in the filter function so it will leave me only with those rows in the
# dataframe in which ALL ratings were 10.

all_tens <- xian %>% 
  filter(eval_gov_overall == 10,
         eval_gov_demo == 10,
         eval_gov_traffic == 10) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

```

5. But only **`r all_tens`** gave the government a 10 rating overall and on
demolitions and on traffic.

```{r mad-lib-6, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 6.

# Similar process to that in mad lib 5, but instead of filtering for just the
# value "A" (which would leave me with those respondents who ONLY get their news
# from Television and exclude those who get news from Television and other
# sources) I filter() for any value in the news_source column which contains the
# letter "A" using str_detect().

tv_respondents <- xian %>% 
  filter(str_detect(news_source, 
                    "A")) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull(n)

```

6. The number of respondents who get their news from Television is 
**`r tv_respondents`**.

```{r mad-lib-7, include=FALSE}

# This r chunk assigns an object to use in mad lib 7.

# As in mad lib 6, I use str_detect() to filter() for values in the location
# column which contain "square". After running that command and looking at the
# resulting table, I see that rows 1 and 4 are the first rows in the dataframe
# to contain their respective values, so I slice() those rows and pull() the
# values, assigning them to square_locations.

square_locations <- xian %>% 
  filter(str_detect(location, 
                    "square")) %>% 
  slice(1, 4) %>% 
  pull(location)

```

7. Of the 4 different locations where the respondents were surveyed, the
following two locations end with “square”: **`r square_locations`**.

## Data Wrangling

**1.a**

```{r table-untidy, echo=FALSE}

# This r chunk first creates a new subset of the xian data with the columns
# requested by the assignment, then uses that subset to produce a neat (but
# untidy) table.

# which I want them to appear in my table.

  select(respondent, 
         eval_gov_overall, 
         eval_gov_traffic,

# Now making the table itself.

xian_subset_untidy %>% 
  
# Slicing the first ten rows because the assignment asks for the first ten
# respondents (and in this dataframe, one respondent is on each row).
  
  slice(1:10) %>%

  gt() %>% 
  
# Adding header

**1.b**

# pretty.

# or equal to 10; can't just slice() the first ten rows this time, because each
# respondent takes up three rows.

# Changing the values in the "type" column to a prettier-to-display version of
# themselves so they'll show up nicely in my table.
